## Next Release

* BREAKING CHANGES:

  ```dart
  /// old
  TwilioVoice.instance
  
  // new 
  TwilioVoicePlatform.instance
  ```
* Feat: [Web] Add Twilio Device [DeviceState] accessor protecting un/registration.
* Feat: [Web] Add Twilio Device `updateToken(String)` function to allow updating of active device tokens.
* Fix: [Web] Twilio Device does not unregister on `unregister()` method call due to 'device.off' not visible in js object causing device event listeners to remain attached on unregistered device.
* Feat: [Web] Check unnecessary updating device with the same token. 
* Feat: [Web] Update internal [CallStatus] mapping method.
* Fix: [Web] Await Twilio Device `register()` and `unregister()` method calls.
* Fix: [Web] Prevent duplicate `TwilioVoiceWeb` instances.
* Feat: [iOS] Add support for call logging via `enableCallLogging(bool)` to record call in recents. No other platform currently supports this, see [NOTES.md](NOTES.md#limitations) for more details.
